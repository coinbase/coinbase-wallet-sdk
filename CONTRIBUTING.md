## How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Coinbase Wallet SDK!

All contributions, no matter how big or small, are appreciated regardless of your experience level. There are various ways to contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check the [Issues](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/issues)** to see if there's someone who has already suggested the same enhancement.

2. If it doesn't exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/issues/new). Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.

2. **Make your changes**: Apply your changes, following the coding conventions described below.

3. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Describe what you did in the pull request description. Mention the issue number if your pull request is related to an existing issue.

5. **Include Screenshots**: If your pull request includes any visual changes to the project, please include before and after screenshots in your pull request description to help us better understand the changes.

6. **Wait for review**: Once your pull request is opened, it will be reviewed as soon as possible. Changes may be requested, and your responsiveness is appreciated.

## Setting up your development environment

### Installing dependencies

First, ensure that the following are installed globally on your machine:

- [Node.js 20.11+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases)
- [Yarn v3](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Then, from the root folder run:

- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn build` to build the package
- `yarn dev` to start the example app and build the package with hot reloading
- `yarn test` to ensure that the test suite runs correctly

### Navigating the codebase

The SDK is built using yarn workspaces. 

- `packages/wallet-sdk` - The main package that exports the SDK
- `examples/test-app` - An example React app that is used to test the SDK in a real browser environment

Use `yarn dev` to start the example app and build the package with hot reloading.

### Linting and formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) for linting and formatting. See the [Biome docs](https://biomejs.dev/guides/editors/first-party-extensions/) for more information on how to configure your editor to use Biome.

### Signing Commits

All commits need to be signed with a GPG key. This adds a second factor of authentication that proves that it came from
you, and not someone who managed to compromise your GitHub account. You can enable signing by following these steps:

1. [Generate GPG Keys](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key) and upload them to your Github account, [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) is recommended for OSX

2. Use `gpg-agent` to remember your password locally

```bash
vi ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

default-cache-ttl 100000000
max-cache-ttl 100000000
```

3. Configure Git to [use your keys when signing](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/telling-git-about-your-signing-key).

4. Configure Git to always sign commits by running `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`

5. Commit all changes with your usual git commands and you should see a `Verified` badge near your commits

## Coding Conventions
