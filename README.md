WalletLink
==========

WalletLink is an open protocol that lets users connect their mobile wallets to
your DApp.

With WalletLink, users can use your DApp in any desktop browser without
installing an extension, and end-to-end encryption using client-side generated
keys keeps all user activity private.

For DApp developers to integrate with WalletLink, all you need to do is drop a
few lines of code into your application, and WalletLink will take care of the
rest. WalletLink is open-source and uses minimal dependencies for maximum
security and no code bloat.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
# With Yarn
yarn add walletlink

# With NPM
npm install walletlink
```

The following instructions are in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
but the usage is the same in JavaScript, except for the occasional type
annotations, for example `: string[]` or `as any`.

### Initializing WalletLink and a WalletLink-powered Web3 object

```typescript
// TypeScript
import WalletLink from "walletlink"
import Web3 from "web3"

const APP_NAME = "My Awesome App"
const APP_LOGO_URL = "https://example.com/logo.png"
const ETH_JSONRPC_URL = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY>"
const CHAIN_ID = 1

// Initialize WalletLink
export const walletLink = new WalletLink({
  appName: APP_NAME,
  appLogoUrl: APP_LOGO_URL
})

// Initialize a Web3 Provider object
export const ethereum = walletLink.makeWeb3Provider(ETH_JSONRPC_URL, CHAIN_ID)

// Initialize a Web3 object
export const web3 = new Web3(ethereum as any)

// Optionally, have the default account be set automatically when available
ethereum.on("accountsChanged", (accounts: string[]) => {
  web3.eth.defaultAccount = accounts[0]
})
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0]
```

### Use EIP-1102 to obtain authorization and get Ethereum accounts

Invoking EIP-1102 will show a QR code dialog if the user's mobile wallet is not
already connected to their browser. The following code should run in response to
a user-initiated action such as clicking a button to ensure the pop up is not
blocked by the browser.

```typescript
// Use eth_RequestAccounts
ethereum.send("eth_requestAccounts").then((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`)

})

// Alternatively, you can use ethereum.enable()
ethereum.enable().then((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`)
})
```

That's it! Once the authorization is obtained from the user, the Web3 object
(`web3`) and the Web3 Provider (`ethereum`) are ready to be used as per usual.
