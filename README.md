# Coinbase Wallet SDK

Coinbase Wallet SDK (formerly WalletLink) lets developers connect their dapps to Coinbase Wallet
on both mobile web (for iOS and Android) and desktop:

- **Mobile**: Users can connect to your mobile web dapp through a deeplink to the dapp browser in [Coinbase Wallet Mobile App](https://coinbase-wallet.onelink.me/q5Sx/fdb9b250).

- **Desktop**: Users can connect to your desktop app with a QR code in the [Coinbase Wallet Mobile App](https://coinbase-wallet.onelink.me/q5Sx/fdb9b250) or with the [Coinbase Wallet Chrome Extension](https://coinbase-wallet.onelink.me/q5Sx/fdb9b250).

Wallet SDK is open-source and uses minimal dependencies for maximum security and no code bloat. Simply drop a few lines of code into your dapp and Wallet SDK takes care of the rest.

## Getting started

This repo uses a yarn workspace. To get started, run:

```shell
yarn install

# To start the development server run the following command. This starts a nextjs app on port 3001. Any changes in the SDK become available through the app.
yarn dev

# To interact with the SDK directly:
yarn workspace @coinbase/wallet-sdk "<command>"

# To lint all files
yarn lint

# To typecheck all files
yarn typecheck
```
