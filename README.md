# Coinbase Wallet SDK

Coinbase Wallet SDK (formerly WalletLink) lets developers connect their dapps to Coinbase Wallet
on both mobile web (for iOS and Android) and desktop: 

- **Mobile**: Users can connect to your mobile web dapp through a deeplink to the 
dapp browser in Coinbase Wallet Mobile App.

- **Desktop**: Users can connect to your desktop app with a QR code in the 
Coinbase Wallet Mobile App or with the Coinbase Wallet Chrome Extension.

Wallet SDK is open-source and uses minimal dependencies for maximum security 
and no code bloat. Simply drop a few lines of code into your dapp and Wallet 
SDK takes care of the rest.

## Initializing Wallet SDK and a Wallet SDK-powered Web3 object

> Instructions are in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The usage 
is the same in JavaScript, except for the occasional TypeScript type 
annotation such as `string[]` or `as any`.


```typescript
// TypeScript
import CoinbaseWalletSDK from '@coinbase/wallet-sdk'
import Web3 from 'web3'

const APP_NAME = 'My Awesome App'
const APP_LOGO_URL = 'https://example.com/logo.png'
const DEFAULT_ETH_JSONRPC_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY>'
const DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID = 1

// Initialize Coinbase Wallet SDK
export const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWalletSDK({
  appName: APP_NAME,
  appLogoUrl: APP_LOGO_URL,
  darkMode: false
})

// Initialize a Web3 Provider object
export const ethereum = coinbaseWallet.makeWeb3Provider(DEFAULT_ETH_JSONRPC_URL, DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID)

// Initialize a Web3 object
export const web3 = new Web3(ethereum as any)
```

Coinbase Wallet SDK uses an rpcUrl provided by Coinbase Wallet clients 
regardless of the rpcUrl passed into `makeWeb3Provider` for whitelisted 
networks. Wallet SDK needs an rpcUrl to be provided by the dapp as a fallback.

For more information on using alternate networks, see Switching / Adding Alternative EVM-Compatible Chains below.

## Getting Ethereum Accounts

Use [EIP-1102](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1102) to obtain authorization and get Ethereum accounts. Invoking EIP-1102 shows a QR code dialog if the user's mobile wallet is not already connected to your app. 

The following code runs in response to a user-initiated action such as clicking a button to ensure the pop up is not blocked by the browser.

```typescript
// Use eth_requestAccounts
ethereum.request('eth_requestAccounts').then((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`)

  // Optionally, have the default account set for web3.js
  web3.eth.defaultAccount = accounts[0]
})

// Alternatively, you can use ethereum.enable()
ethereum.enable().then((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`)
  web3.eth.defaultAccount = accounts[0]
})
```

Once the user obtains authorization, the Web3 object (`web3`) and the Web3 
Provider (`ethereum`) are ready to be used.

> If you were using `ethereum.on("accountsChanged")`, remove it and obtain 
addresses with EIP-1102 callbacks instead. It was removed to improve 
compatibility with the latest web3.js.


## Switching / Adding Alternative EVM-Compatible Chains

Coinbase Wallet SDK and Coinbase Wallet clients support both [EIP-3326](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3326) `wallet_switchEthereumChain` and [EIP-3085](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3085) `wallet_addEthereumChain` requests for switching networks.

For dapps supporting multiple networks, Coinbase Wallet SDK only needs 1 rpcUrl -- the rpcUrl of the chain the dapp wishes to default users to.

If Wallet SDK receives either a `wallet_switchEthereumChain` or `wallet_addEthereumChain` request for a whitelisted network, then it switches the user to that network after asking approval from the user.

Current whitelisted networks: 

| Whitelisted Networks        |
|:----------------------------|
| Arbitrum                    |
| Arbitrum Rinkeby            |
| Avalanche                   |
| Avalanche Fuji              |
| Binance Smart Chain         |
| Binance Smart Chain Testnet |
| Ethereum                    |
| Fantom                      |
| Fantom Testnet              |
| Gorli                       |
| Kovan                       |
| Optimism                    |
| Optimistic Kovan            |
| Polygon                     |
| Polygon Mumbai              |
| Rinkeby                     |
| Ropsten                     |
| xDai                        |

Coinbase Wallet clients handle `wallet_addEthereumChain` requests for non-whitelisted networks (for example, a network such as `Harmony One` which is not currently supported by clients by default).

A dapp can determine if a network is whitelisted or not by sending a `wallet_switchEthereumChain` request for that network. If error code 4092 is returned, then the network is not supported by default by the client wallet.

### Example

Here's how to request the wallet switch networks:

```
await ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
  params: [{ chainId: '0xA86A' }]
})      
```

Here's how to request the client wallet add a new network

```
          await ethereum.request({
            method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
            params: [{
              chainId: '0x63564C40',
              rpcUrls: ['https://api.harmony.one'],
              chainName: 'Harmony Mainnet',
              nativeCurrency: { name: 'ONE', decimals: 18, symbol: 'ONE' },
              blockExplorerUrls: ['https://explorer.harmony.one'],
              iconUrls: ['https://harmonynews.one/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/slfdjs.png'],
            }],
          })
```

Many dapps attempt to switch to a network with `wallet_switchEthereumChain`, 
determine if the network is supported by the wallet based on the error code, 
and follow with a `wallet_addEthereumChain` request if the network is not 
supported. Here's an example:

```
    try {
      // attempt to switch to Harmony One network
      const result = await ethereum.send('wallet_switchEthereumChain', [{ chainId: `0x63564C40` }])
    } catch (switchError) {
      // 4902 indicates that the client does not recognize the Harmony One network
      if (switchError.code === 4902) {
          await ethereum.request({
            method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
            params: [{
              chainId: '0x63564C40',
              rpcUrls: ['https://api.harmony.one'],
              chainName: 'Harmony Mainnet',
              nativeCurrency: { name: 'ONE', decimals: 18, symbol: 'ONE' },
              blockExplorerUrls: ['https://explorer.harmony.one'],
              iconUrls: ['https://harmonynews.one/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/slfdjs.png'],
            }],
          })
      }
    }
```

### Suggest client wallet track a specific token with EIP-747

Calling `wallet_watchAsset` method returns true/false if the asset is accepted/denied by the user, or an error if there is something wrong with the request.

Unlike other methods, the default definition of `wallet_watchAsset` params is not an array, but to keep it compatible with code conventions of other dapps, wallet-sdk supports both array and object format.

```typescript
interface WatchAssetParameters {
  type: string // The asset's interface, e.g. 'ERC20'
  options: {
    address: string // The hexadecimal Ethereum address of the token contract
    symbol?: string // A ticker symbol or shorthand, up to 5 alphanumerical characters
    decimals?: number // The number of asset decimals
    image?: string // A string url of the token logo
  }
}
```

Here's an example of how to suggest the client wallet add a custom token:

```typescript
function onApproveWatchAsset() {
  // your approval callback implementation
}

function onDenyWatchAsset() {
  // your denying callback implementation
}

function onError(message: string) {
  // your error callback implementation
}

// Use wallet_watchAsset
ethereum.request({
  method: "wallet_watchAsset",
  params: {
    type: "ERC20",
    options: {
      address: "0xcf664087a5bb0237a0bad6742852ec6c8d69a27a",
      symbol: "WONE",
      decimals: 18,
      image:
        "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/11696.png",
    },
  },
  ,
})
.then((result: boolean) =>
  result ? onApproveWatchAsset() : onDenyWatchAsset()
)
.catch(err => onError(err.message));
```

## Disconnecting a Link

To disconnect or disestablish a link, call the instance method `disconnect()` on the `CoinbaseWallet` object/instance, or the instance method `close()` on the Coinbase Wallet SDK Web3 Provider object. This disestablishes the link, and requires the user to reconnect by scanning QR code again.

```typescript
coinbaseWallet.disconnect()
// is the same as the following:
ethereum.close()
```
